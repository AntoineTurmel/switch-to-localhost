# Switch to localhost

Web Extension to switch current tab to a localhost URL.

If you're too lazy to manually change your current url to localhost, just click on this extension icon in your toolbar.

For instance, if you're on the page [https://timecop-app.com/login](https://timecop-app.com/login), it will redirect you you to [localhost:3000/login](localhost:3000/login).

It will keep all your params.
